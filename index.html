<h1>Welcome to my ePortfolio</h>
<h2>Keanu Cendejas CS-499</h2>
<h3>Professional Self-Assessment</h3>
<pre>  By completing the coursework throughout the Computer Science program I have been
able to develop my skills and gain more experience. One example of my coursework is I have
worked on multiple game projects as part of a team. The team included people across different
disciplines such as artists and programmers and helped develop my ability to collaborate in a
team environment through the production of a video game. Another example is that as part of
CS-465 I created a full-stack web application, which included security authorization and the
implementation of a database and interface using MongoDB. All of these skills I’ve developed 
throughout the Computer Science program align with my professional goals of being employed 
into the software development industry.
  The artifact I’ve chosen for my ePortfolio is a project from CS360. The artifact is an
inventory management application for mobile phones built in android studio with java as the
main programming language.</pre>

<h3>Enhancement Narratives:</h3>
  <p>The artifact I chose to showcase my skills is an inventory management application for mobile phones. It was created as a project for CS360. </p>
<h3>Enhancement 1</h3>
  <p>I selected this item to include in my ePortfolio because it showcases my abilities in building a complete software application.<br> 
    This enhancement is meant to showcase my skills with security authorizations for user accounts. I learned about the security features<br>
    that android has and how to implement security tokens for authenticating users. A challenge I faced was figuring out how to configure<br>
    the security settings for my project. The solution I found was to look up the correct security protocols to use for my project.</p>
<h3>Enhancement 2</h3>
  <p>The specific components that showcase my skills and abilities in algorithms and data structures is the use of fragments to hold<br>
    information on dynamically created objects that the user can add or remove. While implementing this enhancement I learned how to<br>
    properly use fragments in Java for android app development. A challenge I faced was getting the correct dependencies to work with<br>
    my project.</p>
<h3>Enhancement 3</h3>
  <p>I chose this item because it already had the framework of being an inventory management application. The parts that showcase my<br>
    skills are the inclusion of a NoSQL database that allows users to add items to the inventory app. While implementing this enhancement<br> 
    I learned how to set up a MongoDB database using Java for an android application.</p>
