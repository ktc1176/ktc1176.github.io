<h3>Enhancement Narratives:</h3>
  <p>The artifact I chose to showcase my skills is an inventory management application for mobile phones. It was created as a project for CS360. </p>
<h3>Enhancement 1</h3>
  <p>I selected this item to include in my ePortfolio because it showcases my abilities in building a complete software application.<br> 
    This enhancement is meant to showcase my skills with security authorizations for user accounts. I learned about the security features<br>
    that android has and how to implement security tokens for authenticating users. A challenge I faced was figuring out how to configure<br>
    everything for my project. </p>
<h3>Enhancement 2</h3>
  <p>The specific components that showcase my skills and abilities in algorithms and data structures is the use of fragments to hold<br>
    information on dynamically created objects that the user can add or remove. While implementing this enhancement I learned how to<br>
    properly use fragments in Java for android app development. A challenge I faced was getting the correct dependencies to work with<br>
    my project.</p>
<h3>Enhancement 3</h3>
  <p>I chose this item because it already had the framework of being an inventory management application. The parts that showcase my<br>
    skills are the inclusion of a NoSQL database that allows users to add items to the inventory app. While implementing this enhancement<br> 
    I learned how to set up a MongoDB database using Java for an android application.</p>
